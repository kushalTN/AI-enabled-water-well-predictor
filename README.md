# AI-enabled-water-well-predictor
The web-based system uses NAQUIM data and AI to guide users on water well construction. It predicts site suitability, depth of water-bearing zones, expected discharge, drilling methods, and groundwater quality. With a user-friendly interface and feedback options, it offers reliable, location-specific decision support for groundwater management.


An AI-powered decision-support system that predicts **well suitability**, **aquifer (WBZ) depth**, **expected discharge (LPM)**, **drilling method**, and **water quality** using machine learning and geospatial data. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

The tool provides a **map-based interface** where users can select a location and instantly get groundwater predictions.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

In many rural and semi-urban regions, borewell locations are chosen based on guesswork or limited local knowledge. This often results in:

- Dry or low-yield wells  
- Wasted drilling cost and effort  
- Continued water insecurity  

This project uses **Machine Learning** to make groundwater exploration **data-driven, transparent, and more reliable**.
